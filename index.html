<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Although originally a student at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, I relocated to Harrisonburg Virginia to attend James Madison University in the fall of 2021. I'm currently a junior pursuing a double degree in both interactive design and creative writing. I'm incredibly passionate about user-centered design and learning how to create intuitive user interfaces; I have experience creating low and high fidelity prototypes, conducting user research, creating personas and sitemaps as well as experience coding with CSS and HTML. As a result of my English studies, I'm a proficient writer and value the importance of effective communication. I'm skilled at learning new concepts quickly and I accredit this to my genuine passion to learn.</p>
